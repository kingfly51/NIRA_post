\title{Identify Most Frequently Perturbed Nodes in Bootstrap Analysis}
\usage{
findmaxn(Bootresult, n = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bootresult}{List output from \code{\link[=BootNIRAresult]{BootNIRAresult()}} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Matrix with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"original"}: Original network means
\item Other columns: Perturbed network means
}
}}

\item{n}{Integer specifying how many top differences to consider (default: 3).
Returns frequencies for top 1 through top n differences.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two sections per rank (1 to n):

\strong{Frequency Analysis}:
\itemize{
\item \verb{repeattop_*}: Absolute counts of nodes appearing in top n differences
\item \verb{percenttop_*}: Percentage occurrence (counts/total bootstrap samples)
}

Rows represent network nodes, columns show statistics for each rank.
}
\description{
Calculates the frequency and percentage of nodes showing the largest differences
compared to the original simulated sample across bootstrap networks.
}
\section{Algorithm Details}{

\enumerate{
\item Computes absolute differences between original and perturbed means
\item For each bootstrap sample, identifies top n nodes with largest differences
\item Aggregates frequencies across all samples
\item Calculates percentage occurrence
}
}

\examples{
```r
# After running BootNIRAresult()
top_nodes <- findmaxn(Bootresult, n = 3)

# Get most frequently perturbed nodes
head(top_nodes[order(top_nodes$percenttop_1, decreasing = TRUE), ])
```
}

\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=BootNIRAresult]{BootNIRAresult()}} for required input data generation
\item \code{\link[=apply]{apply()}} for matrix operations core to the algorithm
