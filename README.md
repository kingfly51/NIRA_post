install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("kingfly51/NIRA_post")

The data/ directory contains five built-in datasets distributed with the NIRApost package, stored in .rda format for immediate accessibility upon package loading. Users can directly load these datasets into their R environmentâ€”for example, the single_gds dataset can be accessed via:

data("single_gds")

The data_raw/ directory stores the original .xlsx files for all five datasets.
